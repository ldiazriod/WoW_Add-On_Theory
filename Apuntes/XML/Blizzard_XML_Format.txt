XML Tags:

There are a few general notes that you need to know about concerning XML, particularly as it is used by WoW. The generalized format of a "tag" is:

<tagname attribute="attribute value" anotherattribute="anotherattribute value"></tagname>

- They must have zero o more attributes.
- The tag is everything between the '<tagname' and the trailing '>'
- The tag is closed by an "end tag" with the same name as the tag (i.e. '</tagname>')
- Tagnames do not have spaces and ARE case sensitive
- Everything between the tag and the end tag is the CONTENT of the tag. 
- In the case where there is no content to a tag, the tag can be shorted to '<tagname /> instead of '<tagname></tagname>' though both version are valid.

A complete tag with no content looks like:

<tagname attribute="attribute value" anotherattribute="anotherattribute value"/>
