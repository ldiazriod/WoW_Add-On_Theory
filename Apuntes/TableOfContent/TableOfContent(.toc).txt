The lines starting with ## are called ".toc tags" and provide basic information about the AddOn.
The other two lines (not starting with ##) tell WoW which files belong to the AddOn (here HelloWorld.lua and HelloWorld.xml).
Lines starting with # (only one hash; not contained in the example above) are considered comments and are ignored by WoW.
